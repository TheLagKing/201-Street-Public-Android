What do we have here?
It seems a brand new face has wandered into my domain,
Now you know I don't discriminate,
I'll eat'cha all the same, baby.

Join us.
Let the ritual commence,
Let juice pour from the sky,
To those whose lives, forsaken,
Let us FEED on the divine,
Care to join us, for a feast?
The likes of which you've never seen!

Take the stage for one last bow...
May salvation heed your sound...
After all this time,

Let us DINE.

No more fates to tell, cause,
This world will know HELL.
We'll arise once more,
And feast on all impure.
Bending to the master's will.
Till we've all consumed our fill.
Join us on this fateful night.
And let our roots embrace your plight...

Don't look so disillusioned,
I take it you're surprised?
Divinity awaits us,
So guest, enjoy the ride~

Can you feel it?
our destinies aligned~

Cast in shadow,
the thoughts consume your mind~
It's only natural to feed!
Let's leave it all behind,
Let's start a revolution, baby,
Don't let this world deny,
Our ultimate solution.
Let's get it, now.
To taste the truth, divine,
Rid all of their delusion, baby,
And once you're finally mine,
I'll take the time to tell you-
that you won't be missed.

A child of man, sent to spoil our crusade!

Our holy truth, sees that you will be saved!

If only you'd,
Let us into your mind...

Devoted-
yet broken,
Your appetite numbs the time...
You won't be saved.
Salvation's far from here,
Rid yourself, of reason and fear, 'cause,
The monster yearns, for something exciting-
A dish as defiant, as you might do.

Why fight?
On such an accursed night...

Ah, quite the display, wouldn't you say?
A show worthy of applause~

All Hallow's Eve, your last reprieve,
Your corpse entwined in my jaws~
A fervor growing on the holidays...
How would the guest prefer to dine today?
Made into mincemeat,
or broiled and grilled,
We give our thanks to you, for ALL your goodwill!

And, though the centuries pass
Indoctrination of the hunger will last,
A devotee of citrus sharp like a knife
Which is fitting, since we'll be cutting your life
SHORT!
A fervor growing on the holidays~
How would the guest prefer to dine today?
Mashed and smashed,
made into stew,
Trim the fat and simmer, for a victim au jus!

What a great time of year,

There's nothing better, than the taste of
Fear.
