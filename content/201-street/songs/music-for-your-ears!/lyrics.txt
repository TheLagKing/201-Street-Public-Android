So I hear you want to learn about music, it’s true!
Well I have a special lesson planned for you!
So just give me a bit, while I set the stage,
Cuz music can be done in many different ways!
Like firstly-!

Like firstly! There’s some ground rules that need to be...
...set.
hey... c'mon guys.

OKAY! Listen! 'Cause music is all about taking your turn!
Like this patient guy, he has yet to adjourn!
...go on then.
...alright that’s good enough I guess.
Now music needs structure 'cause without there’s no style!
Like loads of fresh groceries left in the aisle!
So get in line mate, everyone gets a face!
'Cause if there’s no structure you’re no better than BEING REPLACED!

With that out of the way, the basics are done!
And now is the time we can REALLY have fun!
Get creative with a large library of sounds!
Like a kick, hat, snare, and whatever else is around!
We can sit here all day and pretend you’re a pro,
but how about some genres that you need to know?
Like happy!

And funky!

On the computer!

And there’s many more choices!
For all different voices!
You’ll just have to accept that it won’t be as GOOD AS THE OTHER ONES.
"So go find the style that speaks true to you,"
Is what they might say when they don’t have the view.
'Cause ignorance is bliss, but if a tree were to twist
and FALL in a FOREST with NO ONE, DID IT TRULY EXIST?

Have you ever had a tune so catchy
that it nestles its way in your brain?
Like a parasite taking its fill;
Coercing you into its refrain?
Have you ever had a track so you
It’s projected to ALL that you know?
I can’t see out beyond the notation and
Hey, where did everyone go?!
My brain chemistry’s been rewired so tight.
It makes me wonder if it’s worth it to fight.
'Cause it feels so right; I’m so understood.
I just had to bite; as everyone should
if they haven’t been seen yet.

IT’S BEEN LOOPING AND LOOPING INSIDE OF MY HEAD!
WITH HOW LOW I'VE BEEN STOOPING, WHAT IS THERE INSTEAD?
THIS IS ALL THERE CAN BE.
THIS IS ALL I BELIEVE.
IF I WENT BACK TO ME, 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MIRROR WOULD SEE.

HOW ABOUT THREE MORE GENRES? THERE'S
EGO

THERE'S GUILT

THERE'S MIXING

AND THERE'S MANY MORE CHOICES
FOR ALL DIFFERENT VOICES!
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH!
